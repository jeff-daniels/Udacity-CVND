# Udacity-Computer-Vision-Nanodegree

This repository contains code used for completing the projects in the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree.

The Nanodegree teaches the foundations of computer vision.  Cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning techniquesâ€”from basic image processing, to building and customizing convolutional neural networks were learned. These concepts to vision tasks such as automatic image captioning and object tracking.  Python, CV2, and PyTorch were used to create a portfolio of vision projects.

The projects include:

Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection  
Project 2: Automatic Image Captioning  
Project 3: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
