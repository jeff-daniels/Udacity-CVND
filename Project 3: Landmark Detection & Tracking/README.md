# Project 3: Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

In this project and implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world was created.  Knowledge of robot sensor measurements and movement was used to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
